LANGMUIR:
---------

This is the source code for the "Langmuir" engine for charge transfer
simulations in molecular transistors.


METHODOLOGY
-----------

The engine is coded using MPI using an object oriented approach. The build
system in use is CMake. The CXX compiler must be set to mpicxx in order to
produce valid executables that are correctly linked. There is only one
executable that figures out which node it should be based upon its rank.
The rank runs sequentially from 0 through to n-1 where n is the number of
processes.

The master node is always rank 0, followed by the agents and the final nodes
are the special electrode nodes.


BUILD INSTRUCTIONS
------------------

In order to build the Langmuir engine the following dependencies are required,

OpenMPI
CMake

To build the engine go to the source directory and run the following commands,

mkdir build; cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=`which mpicxx` ../
make -j5
