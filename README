LANGMUIR:
---------

This is the source code for the "Langmuir" engine for charge transfer
simulations in molecular transistors.


BUILD INSTRUCTIONS
------------------

In order to build the Langmuir engine the following dependencies are required,

Qt4
OpenCL
Eigen
OpenGL ( optional )
GLEW ( optional )
CMake

To build the engine go to the source directory and run the following commands,

mkdir build; cd build
cmake ../

note: on a MAC you may need:
cmake -DCMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES=i386 ../

When using OpenCL to accelerate charge calculations:
 make sure a copy of or symbolic link to the file "kernel.cl" is in the work directory
