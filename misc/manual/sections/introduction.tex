\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}
\Langmuir is a program written in c++ for the simulation of charge transport
    in organic semiconductors.
The simulation works by using Monte Carlo to predict the movement of charge
    carriers on a grid.
Each site on the grid represents an organic semiconducting molecule, and
    charge carriers, such as electrons or holes, can occupy the sites.
During each step of the simulation, all charge carriers propose hopping moves
    to adjacent sites, and use the Metropolis criterion to decide the acceptance
    rate.
\Langmuir monitors the flux of charge carriers in and out of the system,
    allowing the calculation of quantities such as current and mobility.
