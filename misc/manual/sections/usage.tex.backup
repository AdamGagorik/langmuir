    \label{ssec:langmuir}
    \Langmuir is generally run inside a terminal, as shown in
        listing~\ref{lst:langmuir}.
    There is only one argument, the full path to the input file.
    However, note that \Langmuir will write output files to the directory it is
        called from.
    The format of the input file is discussed in section~\ref{sec:input}.
    Often you will run \langmuir on a cluster.
    Details on how to run \langmuir on a cluster, as well as sample batch
        scripts are included in section~\ref{sec:batch}.
